   "comments": "16|C[I think this move is a little bit too close to white's stones.]25|C[This move is good. It makes black thick while attacking the two white groups at the same time.]30|C[The first move here (marked) would be better, because it prevents white from making a base on the bottom and attacks both his groups at once.]48|C[Now you have to make sure that your group lives.]72|C[You should play somewhere else now.]92|C[Black has a big territory in the upper right corner but he still has problems with his weak group.]118|C[Here black has to take care of his weak group in the lower left corner.]126|C[This move only helps white to connect his two groups.]136|C[This was a mistake by white.]144|C[You should try to keep white separated from your other groups if possible.  White can live in the center now.]172|C[This move is not necessary.]192|C[Again this is not necessary.]194|C[It seems like you are trying to save your whole group here. You should just give up a few stones and concentrate on saving your biggest threat (the group marked).]218|C[If black plays there he will capture one stone and then white will get two points for living.]228|C[White wins by 1 point.]234|C[Thanks for pointing out my mistakes and for giving me a chance to review them.]237|C[Hopefully, this review will help you improve your game. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I did writing it!]"
